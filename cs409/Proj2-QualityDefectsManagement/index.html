<h3>Quality and Defects Management</h3>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<ul><li>The testing of software to assure that is lives up to standards</li>
<li>The process in which programmers assure that there are no release-critical bugs remaining in the software</li>
<li>Can be done along the way -- if saved until the end, it might be too costly and time consuming</li></ul>

<h4>Quality Management</h4>

<ul><li>Making sure that software lives up to it's original intention</li>
<li>Assuring that the program's core featureset is functional</li>
<li><b>Test driven development</b> is one way to assure quality in software.</li>
<ol><li>make a list of things you want the program to do</li>
<li>write tests for the first on the list</li>
<li>make sure the test fails (your program should not be written yet)</li>
<li>write the code to make the test pass</li>
<li>rinse, repeat, continue for the rest of the list</li></ol></ul>

<h4>Defect Management</h4>

<ul><li>Staff must work together to squash bugs<li>
<li>Bug Tracking Software (BTS) can be used to manage a list of bugs, issues, and extra information pertaining to them.</li>
<li>There are a lot of free/open source BTSs that are suitable for large scale use, such as:
<ol><li>Bug Genie <img src="buggenie.png" /></li>
<li>Bug Net <img src="bugnet.png" /></li>
<li>Bugzilla <img src="bugzilla.png" /></li>
<li>Mantis <img src="mantis_logo.gif" /></li>
<li>Trac <img src="trac_logo.png" /></li></ol>
<li>Version control systems can also be useful in keeping source code clean while tens or even hundreds of others work simultaneously on it.<ol><li>Git</li><li>SVN</li><li>Mercurial</li><li>CVS (deprecated)</li></ol></li>
