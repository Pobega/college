# college
Random projects/homework/work/papers I worked on while in college at SUNYIT

## bootloader/
A bootloader made to boot in Qemu. dd the binary to the first 512b of a file and boot as a raw image in Qemu to run.

boot.bin should be precompiled and runnable with Qemu.

## classwork/
Miscellaneous classwork, homework and term projects.

## screenshots/
Old screenshots I dug up from my EeePC 901 I used throughout college. The memories :')

## simulator/
A CPU simulator for a custom made architecture. I honestly don't remember the specifics of the architecture anymore, it's lost to time.

## work_cs/
Stuff I wrote when working for the SUNYIT CS Dept. None of this is still in production, and a lot is omitted for privacy concerns.

## work_it/
More stuff I wrote, but for the SUNYIT ITS Dept. No code here, just documentation I wrote on my way out of the job.
